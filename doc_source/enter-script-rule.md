# Enter a script in a rule<a name="enter-script-rule"></a>

There are times when you may need you agents to follow an exact script\. For example, a compliance script that all agents need to follow\. 

To enter a script in a rule, enter phrases\. For example, if you want to highlight when agents say *Thank you for being a member\. We appreciate your business*, enter two phrases: 
+ Thank you for being a member\.
+ We appreciate your business\.

To apply the rule to certain lines of businesses, add a condition for which queues it applies to, or contact attributes\. For example, the following image shows a rule that applies when an agent is working the BasicQueue or Billing and Payments queues, the customer is for auto insurance, and the agent is located in Seattle\.
