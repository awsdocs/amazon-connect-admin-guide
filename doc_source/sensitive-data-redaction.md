# About sensitive data redaction in Contact Lens<a name="sensitive-data-redaction"></a>

To help you protect your customer's privacy, Contact Lens lets you automatically redact sensitive data from conversation transcripts and audio files\. It redacts data, such as name and credit card information using Natural Language Understanding\. 

To enable redaction, choose the option on the **Set recording and analytics behavior** block\. For more information, see [How to enable redaction of sensitive data](enable-analytics.md#enable-redaction)\.

**Important**  
The redaction feature is designed to identify and remove sensitive data\. However, due to the predictive nature of machine learning, it may not identify and remove all instances of sensitive data in a transcript generated by Contact Lens\. We recommend you review any redacted output to ensure it meets your needs\.   
The redaction feature does not meet the requirements for de\-identification under medical privacy laws like the U\.S\. Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 \(HIPAA\), so we recommend you continue to treat it as protected health information after redaction\.

This feature is currently available in US English, AU English, GB English, and IN English\.

## About redacted files<a name="about-redacted-files"></a>

Redacted files are stored in your Amazon S3 bucket: Connect\-instanceARN / Analysis\. You cannot access redacted files through the Amazon Connect console\.

When redaction is enabled, Contact Lens generates the following files:
+ A redacted file\. This file is generated by default when Redaction is enabled\. It's the output schema, with sensitive data redacted\. For an example file, see [Example redacted file](contact-lens-example-output-files.md#example-redacted-file)\.
+ An original \(raw\), analyzed file\. This file is generated only when you choose **Get redacted and original transcripts with redacted audio** in the **Set recording behavior and analytics block**\. For an example file, see [Example original, analyzed file](contact-lens-example-output-files.md#example-original-output-file)\.
**Important**  
The original analyzed file is the only place where the complete conversation is stored\. If you delete it, there will be no record of the sensitive data that was redacted\.
+ A redacted audio file \(wav\)\. Sensitive data in audio files is redacted as silence\. These silent times are not flagged in the Amazon Connect console or elsewhere as non\-talk time\. 

Use your file retention policies to determine how long to keep these files\.
