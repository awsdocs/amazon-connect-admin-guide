# Can't hear indicator for incoming chat?<a name="cant-hear-chat-indicator"></a>

If an agent can't hear the audio indicator for an incoming chat, the problem is likely because Google added an audio policy flag to Chrome\. This flag exists in Chrome versions 71 \- 75\. 

To fix this, add the CCP web site to the allow list in the agent's Chrome settings\. For instructions, see this [Google Chrome Help article](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/114662)\.

For more information about solving audio problems, see [Troubleshooting Issues with the CCP](troubleshooting.md)\.
