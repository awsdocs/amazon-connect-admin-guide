# Contact attribute concepts<a name="using-contact-attributes"></a>

When you create a contact flow, you can create user\-defined contact attributes using **Set contact attributes** blocks\. You can then reference them in other parts of a contact flow using any other block that supports dynamic attributes\. For example, you could use a **Check contact attributes** block to compare the value of an attribute to a condition you define, and then route the contact based on the results of the comparison\. You could also retrieve data from external sources, and then create user\-defined attributes from the external data so that you can reference them later in a contact flow, such as the status of an order or an expected shipping date\.

Personalize the customer experience by including the customer's name when you use text to speech text in a **Play prompt** or **Get customer input** block to speak messages to your customer\. Use contact attributes to store input provided by a customer during an interaction with an Amazon Lex bot to enable automated interactions\.

As a best practice, make attributes and attribute values case\-sensitive, and always match case in each context where they are used\.
