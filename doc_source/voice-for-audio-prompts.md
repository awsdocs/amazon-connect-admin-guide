# Choose the Voice for Audio Prompts<a name="voice-for-audio-prompts"></a>

You select the text\-to\-speech voice and language in the **Set voice** block\. 

You can also use SSML in Amazon Lex bots to modify the voice used by a chat bot when interacting with your customers\. For more information about using SSML in Amazon Lex bots, see [Managing Messages](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lex/latest/dg/howitworks-manage-prompts.html#msg-prompts-response) and [Managing Conversation Context](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lex/latest/dg/context-mgmt.html#special-response) in the Amazon Lex Developer Guide\.

**Tip**  
If you enter text that isn't supported for the Amazon Polly voice you are using, it won't be played\. However, any other supported text in the prompt will be played\. For a list of supported languages, see [Languages Supported by Amazon Polly](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/polly/latest/dg/SupportedLanguage.html)\.
