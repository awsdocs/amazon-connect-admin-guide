To find the ID or ARN for a queue, open **Routing, Queues** in the navigation menu and choose the desired queue. The ARN can be found by expanding **Show additional queue information**. The queue ID is a subset of the ARN and consists of the characters following  `/queue`. For example, `.../queue/aaaaaaaa-bbbb-cccc-dddd-111111111111`\.
