# Historical metrics definitions<a name="historical-metrics-definitions"></a>

The following metrics are available to include in historical metrics reports in Amazon Connect\.

**Tip**  
Developers can use the [GetMetricData ](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/APIReference/API_GetMetricData.html) API to get a subset of the following historical metrics from the specified Amazon Connect instance\.

## After contact work time<a name="acw-historical"></a>

The total time that an agent spent doing ACW for a contact\. 

You specify the amount of time an agent has to do ACW in their [ agent configuration settings](configure-agents.md)\. When a conversation with a contact ends, the agent is automatically allocated to do ACW for the contact\. They stop doing ACW for a contact when they indicate they are ready for another contact in the CCP\.
+ Type: String \(*hh:mm:ss*\)
+ Category: CTR\-driven metric

## Agent answer rate<a name="agent-answer-rate-historical"></a>

Percentage of contacts routed to an agent that were answered\.
+ Type: String 
+ Min value: 0\.00%
+ Max value: 100\.00%
+ Category: Agent activity\-driven metric

## Agent first name<a name="agent-first-name-historical"></a>

The first name of the agent, as entered in their Amazon Connect user account\. This metric is available only when grouping by agent\.
+ Type: String 
+ Length: 1\-255

## Agent idle time<a name="agent-idle-time-historical"></a>

After the agent sets their status in the CCP to **Available**, this is the amount of time they weren't handling contacts \+ any time their contacts were in an Error state\. 

Agent idle time doesnâ€™t include the amount of time from when Amazon Connect starts routing the contact to the agent, to when agent picks up or declines the contact\.
+ Type: String \(*hh:mm:ss*\)
+ Category: Agent activity\-driven metric

## Agent interaction and hold time<a name="agent-interaction-hold-time-historical"></a>

Sum of [Agent interaction time](#agent-interaction-time-historical) and [Customer hold time](#customer-hold-time-historical)\.
+ Type: String \(*hh:mm:ss*\)
+ Category: CTR\-driven metric

## Agent interaction time<a name="agent-interaction-time-historical"></a>

Total time that agents spent interacting with customers on a contact\. This does not include [Customer Hold Time](#customer-hold-time-historical) or [After Contact Work Time](#acw-historical)\.
+ Type: String \(*hh:mm:ss*\)
+ Category: CTR\-driven metric

## Agent last name<a name="agent-last-name-historical"></a>

The last name of the agent, as entered in their Amazon Connect user account\. This metric is available only when grouping by agent\.
+ Type: String 
+ Length: 1\-255

## Agent name<a name="agent-name-historical"></a>

The name of the agent, displayed as follows: **Agent last name**, **Agent first name**\. This metric is available only when grouping by agent\.

## Agent non\-response<a name="agent-non-response"></a>

Count of contacts routed to an agent but not answered by that agent, including contacts abandoned by the customer\. 

If a contact is not answered by a given agent, we attempt to route it to another agent to handle; the contact is not dropped\. Because a single contact can be missed multiple times \(including by the same agent\), it can be counted multiple times: once for each time it is routed to an agent but not answered\.

This metric appears as **Contacts missed** in scheduled reports and exported CSV files\.
+ Type: Integer 
+ Category: Agent activity\-driven metric

## Agent on contact time<a name="agent-on-contact-time-historical"></a>

Total time that an agent spent on a contact, including [Customer Hold Time](#customer-hold-time-historical) and [After Contact Work Time](#acw-historical)\. This does **not** include time spent on a contact while in a custom status\.

+ Category: CTR\-driven metric

## Contacts handled<a name="contacts-handled-historical"></a>

Count of contacts that were connected to an agent\.

It doesnâ€™t matter how the contact got to the agent\. It could be a customer calling your contact center, or an agent calling the customer\.

Total time that agents spent in a [custom status](agent-custom.md)\. That is, their CCP status is other than **Available** or **Offline**\. 

This metric doesn't mean that the agent was spending their time unproductively\. 

**Tip**  
Agents can handle contacts while their CCP status is set to a custom status\. For example, agents can be **On contact** or doing **ACW** while their CCP is set to a custom status\. This means it's possible for agents to be counted as **On contact** and **NPT** at the same time\. 

This metric can't be grouped or filtered by queue\.
+ Type: String \(*hh:mm:ss*\)
+ Category: Agent activity\-driven metric

## Occupancy<a name="occupancy-historical"></a>

\(Agent on contact \(wall clock time\) / \(Agent on contact \(wall clock time\) \+ Agent idle time\)\) 

**Important**  
**Occupancy** doesn't account for concurrency\. That is, an agent is considered 100% occupied for a given interval if they are handling at least one contact for that entire duration\.

+ Max value: 100\.00%
+ Category: Agent activity\-driven metric

The possible values for *X* are: 15, 20, 25, 30, 45, 60, 90, 120, 180, 240, 300, and 600\. This percentage is calculated as follows:

\(Contacts removed from queue in *X* seconds / Contacts queued\) \* 100
+ Type: String
+ Min value: 0\.00%
+ Max value: 100\.00%
+ Category: CTR\-driven metric
