# Configure Agent Settings<a name="configure-agents"></a>

Before you configure your agent settings, here is some info to have on hand\. Of course, you can always change this information later\. 
+ What is their routing profile? They can only be assigned one\. 
+ Will they have the **Agent** security profile or a custom profile you created? 
+ Are they going to use a soft phone? If so, will they be connected to contacts automatically, or will they need to press the **Accept** button in their contact control panel \(CCP\)?
+ Or, are they going to use a desk phone? If so, what is their number?
+  How long do they have for After contact work \(ACW\)?
+ Are they going to be assigned to an agent hierarchy?

**Note**  
You can't configure how long an available agent has to connect with a contact before it's missed\.
