1. **Supervisor** – Manages agents and schedules, updates schedules, manages requests for time off, overtime \(OT\), and voluntary time off \(VTO\)\.

1. **Agent** – Answers contacts, views the generated schedule, manages requests for time off, overtime \(OT\), and voluntary time off \(VTO\)\.

Amazon Connect provides security profile permissions that you can assign to each role, so that you can manage access to specific features by role\. For more information, see [Security profile permissions for Forecasting, capacity planning, and scheduling](required-optimization-permissions.md)\.
