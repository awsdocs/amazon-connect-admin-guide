# What is Amazon Connect?<a name="what-is-amazon-connect"></a>

Amazon Connect is an [omnichannel](amazon-connect-glossary.md#omnichannel-def) cloud contact center\. You can [set up a contact center](amazon-connect-get-started.md) in a few steps, add agents who are located anywhere, and start engaging with your customers\.

You can create personalized experiences for your customers using omnichannel communications\. For example, you can [dynamically offer chat and voice contact](use-channel-contact-attribute.md), based on such factors as customer preference and estimated wait times\. Agents, meanwhile, conveniently handle all customers from just [one interface](agent-user-guide.md)\. For example, they can chat with customers, and create or respond to tasks as they are routed to them\.

Amazon Connect is an open platform that you can integrate with other enterprise applications, such as [Salesforce](salesforce-integration.md)\. You can use Amazon Connect with other AWS services to provide innovative new experiences for your customers\.
