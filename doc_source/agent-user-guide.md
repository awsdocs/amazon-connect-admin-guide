# Agent training guide for the Amazon Connect CCP<a name="agent-user-guide"></a>

Agents use the Amazon Connect Contact Control Panel \(CCP\) to interact with customer contacts\. It's how they receive calls, chat with contacts, transfer them to other agents, put them on hold, and perform other key tasks\.

The URL to launch the CCP is:
+ https://*instance name*\.my\.connect\.aws/ccp\-v2/

Where *instance name* is provided by your IT department or whoever set up Amazon Connect for your business\.

Large businesses often choose to customize their CCP\. For example, they might want to integrate it with a CRM\. However, this section describes how CCP works before it is customized\.

We recently released an updated CCP\. It provides a single interface for agents to manage voice, chat, and tasks\. Even if your business is currently taking only voice contacts, we recommend using the updated CCP\.

The following image shows the CCP\.
