# Example contact flow in Amazon Connect Flow language<a name="flow-language-example"></a>

The following example shows a simple contact flow that plays a prompt using static text and disconnects\. 

To learn how to get block identifiers, we recommend creating a new contact flow in Amazon Connect console, and then calling the [DescribeContactFlow](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeContactFlow.html) API for it\.

```
{
    "Version": "2019-10-30",  //A string representing the version of the Flow. Currently the only supported version is 2019-10-30.
    
    "StartAction": "12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012", //A string representing the first Action to run when the flow starts running. 
                                                          //In this case, it's the identifier of the Play prompt block. 
                                                         //The value of this field must match the Identifier of an Action in the Actions list.
