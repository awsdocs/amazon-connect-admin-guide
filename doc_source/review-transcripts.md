# Review analyzed conversations using Contact Lens<a name="review-transcripts"></a>

By using Contact Lens for Amazon Connect, you can review the transcript and identify what part of the call is of interest\. You won't need to listen to an entire call or read an entire transcript to find out what's interesting about it\. You can focus on specific parts of the audio or transcript\. Both are highlighted for you wherever there are points of interest\. 

For example, you might scan the transcript of the call and see a red sentiment emoji for a customer turn, which indicates the customer is expressing a negative sentiment\. You can choose the timestamp and jump to that portion of audio recording\.
