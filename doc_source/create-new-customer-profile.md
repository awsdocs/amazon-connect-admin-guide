1. Choose **This is the current connected customer**\. This tells Amazon Connect to link the customer profile to the contact ID for the current customer\.

   If you don't select this check box, the profile isn't associated with the current contact\. This is useful when a contact is calling from someone else's number\.

   Enter information in the required boxes, and then choose **Save**\.
