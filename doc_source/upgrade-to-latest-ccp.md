# Upgrade to the latest CCP<a name="upgrade-to-latest-ccp"></a>

The URL for the latest Contact Control Panel \(CCP\) ends with **ccp\-v2**

You only need to upgrade to the latest CCP if you're using one the following options:
+ [The URL for your CCP ends with **/ccp\#**](upgrade-browser-ccp.md)
+ [You use the Amazon Connect Streams API](upgrade-ccp-streams-api.md)\. The URL associated with `initCCP()` ends with **/ccp\#**

If you’re still unsure whether your using the latest CCP, go to [Compare the earlier and latest CCP](upgrade-browser-ccp.md#ui-comparison) to see if your CCP looks like the latest one\. 

## Upgrade on your own schedule, before your automatic upgrade date<a name="upgrade-now"></a>

To upgrade to the latest CCP before your automatic upgrade date, use the steps in the following sections: 
+ [My CCP URL ends with /ccp\#](upgrade-browser-ccp.md)
+ [I use the Amazon Connect Streams API](upgrade-ccp-streams-api.md)

## Upgrade later, automatically<a name="upgrade-automatically"></a>

If you don't want to upgrade now, you can choose to wait until your scheduled upgrade date\. 

Between now and your scheduled upgrade date, we recommend the following change management steps:
+ Compare how the upgraded CCP differs from the earlier one\. For side\-by\-side visuals, see [Compare the earlier and latest CCP](upgrade-browser-ccp.md#ui-comparison)\.
+ Upgrade your CCP in a test environment\. Use the latest CCP to learn how it's different, and to check your configurations\. 
+ Communicate to your agents when the upgrade is going to take place\.
+ Train your agents to help them get ready\.

You can see communications about your auto\-upgrade date in the Personal Health Dashboard\.
