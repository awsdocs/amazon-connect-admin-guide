# Request numbers, international numbers, or termination points<a name="number-request"></a>

**Important**  
To purchase and own a phone number, country or region regulations often require:   
A local office address\.
Specific identification documents\.
For identification requirements by country, see [Region requirements for ordering and porting phone numbers](phone-number-requirements.md)\.   
In most countries it takes 2\-6 weeks for us to fulfill your request\. In some cases it can take up to 60 days\. If you need a number by a certain date, let us know in your AWS Support case\.

**Note**  
Amazon does not provide premium rate or higher cost services\. If you want these services we recommend you contract with specialist providers to route calls into Amazon Connect DIDs following local country regulations\.

To request international phone numbers that require documentation, or numbers not available within a specific region, create an AWS Support case\. In the support case, you must specify exactly how many numbers you want for each country\. 

Submit an Amazon Connect support ticket to verify if your phone number can be ported to Amazon Connect\.
